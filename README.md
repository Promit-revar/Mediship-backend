# Mediship-backend
- This Project was designed to make e-prescription for the medicines by the doctor for each particular patient along with dosage and other specifications.
- Doctor once prescibes the medicine over the application it shows in the patient's device.
- This prescrision can be viewed by the chemist on his application and would return the inventory status of the items mentioned which will make it easier for the patient to go to the right chemist who already have all the prescibed meds in his shop.
